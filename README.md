# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This collection contains links to video demonstrations of various functional systems I have developed. These projects, such as a clinic management system, cannot be shared publicly. However, the videos provide an overview of each system's functionality and key features.

## 1. [Cosparck Company's Official Web Application](https://www.cosparck.com/)
This was the first project I built after recently graduating with a master's degree. The website serves as the official online presence for Cosparck.

- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP

### Project Overview:

#### Client side
The web application features a fully responsive layout, a user-friendly interface, and backend functionality that supports dynamic content. It is built to cater to the needs of the company, allowing users to interact with various features such as:

- **Form Submissions**: Users can submit various forms through the website.
- **Tutorial Videos**: The site includes instructional videos to help users navigate the platform.
- **Messaging System**: I developed a custom messaging system that allows users to communicate with support.
- **Ticket Submission**: A critical feature that allows users to submit support tickets for assistance. This system was designed and built entirely by me.


#### Admin Panel: Solutions for Support & Marketing Teams
In addition to the public-facing website, I developed an **admin panel** (not shown in this repository) that helps streamline customer support and marketing operations.

- **Support Team:** The admin panel allows the support team to efficiently manage and track client support tickets, enabling fast responses and better service.
- **Marketing Solution:** Due to a shortage of team members, I also took on the responsibility of handling marketing tasks. I developed a dynamic solution for styling domains managed by the company's ERP system. 

Although the marketing team was originally meant to handle this, I took full ownership of styling and customizing the domains. This ensured a cohesive, branded online presence across all domains, which you can see in action at [Cosparck Domains](https://www.cosparck.com/domaines).

- **My Role:** I was solely responsible for both the development of the web application and the styling of all the domains. From coding and backend functionality to frontend design and branding, everything was created and managed by me.

## 2. [B2B Online Optic Shop](https://www.cosparck.com/domain?e=82)

This was the second project I developed for the company I work for. The solution is an online **B2B platform** connecting opticians with the factory, enabling them to place orders and manage transactions seamlessly.

The main requirement from the factory was to receive online orders from opticians and relay them to the companyâ€™s ERP system. As part of a collaborative team, I was responsible for developing the core functionality that integrated these orders with the ERP, ensuring that the process was smooth and automated. 

This project was also where I started to build a deeper understanding of **JavaScript** and expand my skills in full-stack web development.

- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, jQuery, JavaScript, MySQL

#### Project Overview:
- The platform allows opticians to browse and place orders for products directly through the online shop.
- The system processes orders and transmits them to the company's ERP system for inventory and order management.
- It was developed as a collaborative effort, where I worked closely with other developers to implement key features, optimize performance, and ensure seamless integration with the backend.

#### My Role:
- **Team Contribution:** As part of a cross-functional development team, I contributed to both the frontend and backend development. I worked alongside other developers, collaborating on the user interface and the backend logic for order processing.
- **Key Responsibilities:** My primary responsibility was developing the integration between the online shop and the ERP system, ensuring that orders were processed correctly and efficiently.
- **Skills Gained:** This project significantly enhanced my experience with JavaScript, Node.js, and database integration. It was an important step in my development as a full-stack developer.
