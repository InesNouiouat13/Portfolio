# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This collection contains links to video demonstrations of various functional systems I have developed. These projects, such as a clinic management system, cannot be shared publicly. However, the videos provide an overview of each system's functionality and key features.

## 1. [Cosparck Company's Official Web Application](https://www.cosparck.com/)
This was the first project I built after recently graduating with a master's degree. The website serves as the official online presence for Cosparck.

- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP

### Project Overview:

#### Client side
The web application features a fully responsive layout, a user-friendly interface, and backend functionality that supports dynamic content. It is built to cater to the needs of the company, allowing users to interact with various features such as:

- **Form Submissions**: Users can submit various forms through the website.
- **Tutorial Videos**: The site includes instructional videos to help users navigate the platform.
- **Messaging System**: I developed a custom messaging system that allows users to communicate with support.
- **Ticket Submission**: A critical feature that allows users to submit support tickets for assistance. This system was designed and built entirely by me.


#### Admin Panel: Solutions for Support & Marketing Teams
In addition to the public-facing website, I developed an **admin panel** (not shown in this repository) that helps streamline customer support and marketing operations.

- **Support Team:** The admin panel allows the support team to efficiently manage and track client support tickets, enabling fast responses and better service.
- **Marketing Solution:** Due to a shortage of team members, I also took on the responsibility of handling marketing tasks. I developed a dynamic solution for styling domains managed by the company's ERP system. 

Although the marketing team was originally meant to handle this, I took full ownership of styling and customizing the domains. This ensured a cohesive, branded online presence across all domains, which you can see in action at [Cosparck Domains](https://www.cosparck.com/domaines).

- **My Role:** I was solely responsible for both the development of the web application and the styling of all the domains. From coding and backend functionality to frontend design and branding, everything was created and managed by me.
